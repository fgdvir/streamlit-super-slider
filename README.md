# streamlit-super-slider
![](./assets/slider_img.png)

Like the regular streamlit slider but with a lot of extra features:

* Update on Release - Tired of streamlit updating when you are in the middle of selecting the value you want in the slider? This slider only updates when mouse is released!.

* Input text to select slider value - In order to easily chose the value in the slider, there is an input text attached to the slider. Changing the value in the input text changes the slider, and changing the slider value changes the input text

* Arrows to increase/decrease value by 1 - In order to easily go to "next" or "previouse" 

A slider component with extra features, is especially useful for ML applications where you want to switch examples easily. This component let you use a slider with some extra features such as keyboard shortcuts to move forward/backward, and button to go forward or backwards + only changes on mouse-release and not on change
